***A description of exclusions  and created (derived) variables***




**Cohort filtering (inclusion-exclusion) flowchart:**
Please see Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Materials of the mansucript for more details
All steps were performed in 'longi_data_assemble.R' file
Start with all 5114 distinct subjects 
--> excluding those with events or censored prior to Y15 Exam: 3639 left
--> excluding those with at least one missing data in Y0 or Y15 Exam: 3551 left 
--> excluding those with self-reported CVD events (e.g., heart attack) before Y15: 3539 left



**Variables inclusion and creation:**
All variables included in this analysis were handpicked.
For the list of variables used, please see Table S1 of the Supplementary Materials
For the list of variables with their corresponding coding, please refer to the variable dictionaries in /code_and_files/csv_files

Deriving new variables:
The variable 'Parent history of heart attack' (PATCK) is a binary variable and a combined version of 'Has mother ever had heart attack' (MATCK) and 'Has father ever had heart attack' (FATCK). The coding is included in 'longi_data_assemble.R' file. Below is the pseudo-code:
IF (MATCK = 1 OR PATCK = 1): PATCK = 1 
ELSE PATCK = 0
